# toDragonSpeak

A simple one-page android app where the user types in a phrase, clicks on the 'translate' button and their phrase is then translated into Dragon Speak. 

Dragon Speak is when the vowels are replaced by special characters:
 A/a is replaced with 4
 E/e is replaced with 3
 I/i is replaced with 1
 O/o is replaced with 0
 U/u is replaced with |_|
 
 So the phrase: "I love apple crumble!" would translate to "1 l0v3 4ppl3 cr|_|mbl3!"
